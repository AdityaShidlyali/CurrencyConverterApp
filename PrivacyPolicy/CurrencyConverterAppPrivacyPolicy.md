## Currency Converter Android App: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Currency Converter app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Aditya Shidlyali. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. Data like converting currencies in app is done by the you is not stored on your device, and the converted currency data is not stored and it is visible and held at the app runtime only(that is when you exit app the converted data is not collected and vanished).

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Aditya Shidlyali.
